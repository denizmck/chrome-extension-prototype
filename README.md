# Chrome Extension Prototype
this project exists to investigate the development of chrome extensions and make a small prototype of the idea.

## Installation
The installation is straight forward.  
The project utilizes TypeScript and SASS therefore node is needed.  
Typescript is setup to be easily compiled by using the `npx tsc` command.  
SASS isn't universally setup - this specific setup uses [LiveSassCompiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass "VSCode Extension Marketplace").  
When using this extension and enabling it everything will compile to the right folder and bundle itself. If not please use own setup.  

## Idea
The core idea is to make an healthy office life easier.  
The extension will save important information like drink amount, food amount and workout time. This will be evaluated from the software to generate experience points.
These experience points will result in level ups which motivates the user to do more.  
Obviously this is gimmicky and can easily be cheated on but its no tracking tool or spy software - the experience will be dependent on the user.  

### Activity Diagram
This first UML Diagram will show what the core idea experience would be like
