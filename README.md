# Chrome Extension Prototype
this project exists to investigate the development of chrome extensions and make a small prototype of the idea.

## Installation
This prototype utilizes Angular.  
When cloning just type `npm i` at the root of the project to install all dependencies.
You start the project by typing `ng serve`. This will start a development server at `127.0.0.1:4200`.
This will only be for development purposes.

## Idea
The core idea is to make an healthy office life easier.  
The extension will save important information like drink amount, food amount and workout time. This will be evaluated from the software to generate experience points.
These experience points will result in level ups which motivates the user to do more.  
Obviously this is gimmicky and can easily be cheated on but its no tracking tool or spy software - the experience will be dependent on the user.  

### Activity Diagram
This first UML Diagram will show what the core idea experience would be like
